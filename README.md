1. Project Statement:
Student Wellness Monitor
2.Name: THRISHA 
3. Problem Statement
Modern students face stress, irregular sleep, and lack of exercise, affecting their mental and physical health. There is no simple interactive tool that monitors wellness and provides instant feedback based on daily habits and emotions.
4. Project Objective
To create an AI-inspired wellness monitoring system for students that:
Tracks mood, sleep, stress, and exercise.
Calculates a wellness score based on user input.
Provides visual feedback and motivational insights.
Uses interactive animations and playful UI to engage students.
5. Solution Overview
The Student Wellness Monitor is a web-based interactive tool that evaluates student wellness by combining multiple input factors:
Mood (Happy, Okay, Stressed, Sad)
Sleep Hours
Stress Level (1–10)
Exercise Minutes
The system calculates a wellness score (0–100) and gives personalized feedback, with visual cues like emojis, animated score bars, and gradient backgrounds. High scores trigger a celebratory emoji animation to make the experience engaging.
Innovation / AI Aspect:
While no heavy ML model is used, the tool mimics an AI wellness coach by dynamically assessing multiple parameters, providing real-time scoring, and responding to user input intelligently. This approach can be extended with AI predictions for stress, mood trends, and wellness recommendations.
